\usage{
route(
  from = NA,
  to = NA,
  costing = "auto",
  unit = "kilometers",
  from_search_filter = list(max_road_class = "motorway", min_road_class =
    "residential"),

\arguments{
\item{from}{A tibble containing one origin location in columns named \code{lat} and
\code{lon}.}

\item{to}{A tibble containing one destination location in columns named \code{lat} and
\code{lon}.}

\item{costing}{The travel costing method. Values "auto", "bicycle", and "pedestrian"
all work.}

\item{unit}{Distance measurement units. Defaults to "kilometres".}

\item{from_search_filter}{A named list of options provided to Valhalla API. Defaults set a
maximum road class ("motorway", the highest) and minimum road class ("residential",
which is one above the lowest, "service_other"). See API documentation for details.}

\item{to_search_filter}{A named list of options provided to Valhalla API. Defaults set a
maximum road class ("motorway", the highest) and minimum road class ("residential",
which is one above the lowest, "service_other"). See API documentation for details.}

\item{minimum_reachability}{The minimum number of nodes a candidate network
needs to have before it is included. Try increasing this value (e.g. to
500) if Valhalla is getting stuck in small disconnected road networks.}

\item{costing_options}{A named list of options provided to the Valhalla API that affect route costing,
e.g. willingness to travel on highways or through alleys. See API documentation for details.}

\item{hostname}{Hostname or IP address of your Valhalla instance. Defaults to "localhost".}

\item{port}{The port your Valhalla instance is monitoring. Defaults to 8002.}
}
\value{
A trip object.
}
\description{
This function calls Valhalla's \code{route} API to return turn-by-turn directions from one
origin to one destination. Several costing methods are supported, and there are
parameters that let you give custom options to Valhalla. \strong{Please note that this
function requires access to a running instance of Valhalla.}
